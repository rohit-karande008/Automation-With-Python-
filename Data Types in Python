Data types define what kind of data a variable can hold.
Python has several built-in data types. Here are the most common ones:  
1. str (String) → For text
Example
  name = "Rohit"
  print("Hello,", name)
  Output : Hello Rohit
  Used for: Words, sentences, any kind of text

2. int (Integer) → Whole numbers
Example
age = 25
print("Age is:", age)
Output : Age is 26
Used for: Counting, math, indexing, etc.

3. float (Floating-point) → Decimal numbers
Example
price = 19.99
print("Price:", price)
Output : Price: 10.5
Used for: Measurements, currency, percentages.

x = 10
print(type(x))
